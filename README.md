# Monocol
Genius for lecture notes.

In a typical course of 30 students, every student spends a significant ammount of their time studying the lecture notes. However this is usually an individual process. If they study the lecture notes for 30 hours per term, collaboratively they spend 900 hours on the lecture notes!

Monocol aims to provide a collaborative platform for students to study and improve the lecture notes. Students can propose alternatives to phrasing, new point of views and point out mistakes. Furthermore, students can ask quesitons and get them answered. This provides a targeted FAQ, unlike traditional forums.

Ultimately, the idea would be to have collaboratively evolving lecture notes based on the proposed alternatives and the reaction of the students to the alternatives (e.g. through upvotes).
